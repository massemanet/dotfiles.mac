Experience

  2003-present: System Expert at Ericsson Telecom, Hungary 

    Implemented a suite of profiling and troubleshooting tools for
    Erlang applications. Enabled us to identify numerous bottlenecks,
    significantly improving performance. 
    In order to write the GUI for the profiler I invented and
    implemented a GTK binding for Erlang. The C-side is a daemon
    implementing the Erlang distribution protocol. Most of the C code
    is generated from the GTK header files.

  1997-2003: System expert at Ericsson Telecom, Sweden 

    Implemented the first distributed version of our product. Allowed
    us to scale out the application on multiple CPUs.
    Invented the first serious Erlang troubleshooting tools. Still in
    heavy in-house use.

  1993-1997: Post Doctoral Researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, CA, USA

    Wrote major pieces of the software for the E896 experiment at Brookhaven
    National Lab, including the on-line monitoring system, the event
    visualization, and most of the track reconstruction.

    Wrote most of the statistical analysis code for the TRANSPORT
    experiment at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.

  1986-1992: Graduate school at the University of Goteborg, Sweden

    Wrote many pieces of code for several experiments, mostly related to
    data analysis and visualization.

    Awarded a grant by the Sweden-America Foundation to spend a year at
    Michigan State University, MI, USA.

    Awarded a grant to develop a simple data analysis program for the
    Mac to be used in undergrad teaching lab. It was still in use when
    I graduated.

  1986: Software contractor

    Hired over summer break by the Nuclear Physics group at the
    University to develop a data visualization program for nuclear
    physics experiments. Hugely impressed everyone since it used 2-D
    graphics.

Open Source Programs

    Available at code.google.com:
    gtknode - an Erlang GTK binding
    eper - a set of tools for performance tuning distributed Erlang applications

    Contributed to distel (Erlang-Emacs interface) and Yaws (Erlang web server)
